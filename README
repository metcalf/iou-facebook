# IOU Facebook

Written: Summer 2008

IOU Facebook is a Facebook app written in Ruby on Rails that was designed to help track 
bills and other expenses for my college house. We used it full time for about a year before I
retired it after graduation.  It is my second attempt to write a Rails app for this purpose
after [moneyonrails](https://github.com/narced133/moneyonrails).
